Complete:
General architecture
Uplink/downlink
Threads run fine
Catching keyboard interrupt
printing "telem" to UI
configuration handshake on startup(tcp)
sensor reading (sucks tho)


Update:
thread timing (20 mins)
make UI look better(2 hours)
logging (2 people 2 hours ?)
sensor reading using ioctls (12 hours + lead time)

TODO:
implement telem/command queues (1 hour)
IP hardware integration (2 people 2 hours [in person])
sensor hardware integration (2 hours)
safe shutdown (4 hours)
command call backs (2 hours once queues are done)

This will get us 90% there and the last 10% wont happen until we start testing
because we wont know what's wrong until then.
